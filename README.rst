About
=====

**Brittle Wit is a Twitter Lib for Python.**

-  It uses `asyncio <https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html>`__,
   `aiohttp <http://aiohttp.readthedocs.org/en/stable/>`__, and Python
   3.5+ (async/await).
-  It is rigorously polite in its adherence to `Twitter's rate
   limits <https://dev.twitter.com/rest/public/rate-limiting>`__.
-  It scales well.
-  It works as a library or a server.

Warning
-------

I started developing this package months ago. I wanted to create some
tools for for media company agenda management. But, I ran out of
safety-net cash, and had to go back to a 9â€“5 (on top of my Ph.D. work).
Consequently, this library is unfinished and certainly buggy. I'm
releasing it earlier than I'd prefer as a mean of facilitating
replicability for a post I wrote on Medium.

Developer, beware.

Installation
------------

From a Python 3.5 environment,

.. code:: bash

    pip install brittle_wit
