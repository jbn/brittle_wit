About
=====

**Brittle Wit is a Twitter Lib for Python.**

-  It uses `asyncio <https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html>`__,
   `aiohttp <http://aiohttp.readthedocs.org/en/stable/>`__, and Python
   3.5+ (async/await).
-  It is rigorously polite in its adherence to `Twitter's rate
   limits <https://dev.twitter.com/rest/public/rate-limiting>`__.
-  It scales well.
-  It works as a library or a server.

"Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!"

Warning
-------

I started developing this package months ago. I wanted to create some
tools for for media company agenda management. But, I ran out of
safety-net cash, and had to go back to a 9â€“5 (on top of my Ph.D. work).
Consequently, this library is unfinished and certainly buggy. I'm
releasing it earlier than I'd prefer as a mean of facilitating
replicability for a post I wrote on Medium.

Developer, beware.

Installation
------------

From a Python 3.5 environment,

.. code:: bash

    pip install brittle_wit

Simple Example
--------------

.. code:: python

    from brittle_wit.app import load_app_cred, load_single_user_cred, App
    from brittle_wit.patterns import (collect_follower_ids_for,
                                      collect_lists_with_members,
                                      collect_user_infos_by_ids)

    # Reads ENV variables: TWITTER_APP_KEY, TWITTER_APP_SECRET
    APP_CRED = load_app_cred()

    # Reads ENV variables: TWITTER_USER_ID, TWITTER_USER_TOKEN, TWITTER_USER_SECRET
    CLIENT_CRED = load_single_user_cred()

    with App.reactor(APP_CRED) as app:
        ctx = app.client_context(CLIENT_CRED)
        followers_of = app.run_until_complete(collect_follower_ids_for(ctx, 'generativist'))
        lists_of = app.run_until_complete(collect_lists_with_members(ctx, 'generativist'))
        followers_infos = app.run_until_complete(collect_user_infos_by_ids(ctx, followers_of))
