def ids(stringify_ids, cursor):
    """
    Returns an array of numeric user ids the authenticating user is blocking.

    :param stringify_ids: Many programming environments will not consume our
        ids due to their size. Provide this option to have ids returned as
        strings instead. Read more about Twitter IDs.

    :param cursor: Causes the list of IDs to be broken into pages of no more
        than 5000 IDs at a time. The number of IDs returned is not guaranteed
        to be 5000 as suspended users are filtered out after connections are
        queried. If no cursor is provided, a value of -1 will be assumed, which
        is the first “page.” The response from the API will include a
        previous_cursor and next_cursor to allow paging back and forth. See
        Using cursors to navigate collections for more information.
